intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel Erewhon.[1] This drew on an earlier (1863) article of his, &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot;, where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species.[2] The creature in Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being, for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss.[3] Such beings appeared, too, in classical antiquity.</p></td><td>1</td><td>paragraph</td></tr><tr><td><p>Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.[6] It is a recurrent theme in science fiction, whether utopian, emphasising the potential benefits, or dystopian, emphasising the dangers.[7] For example, the film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career, and it plays an important part in his films Prometheus, Blade Runner, and the Alien franchise.</p></td><td>2</td><td>paragraph</td></tr><tr><td><figure class="figure"><img
